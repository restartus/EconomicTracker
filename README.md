# Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker Data Downloads

The Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker (https://tracktherecovery.org) combines anonymized data from leading private companies – from credit card processors to payroll firms – to provide a real-time picture of indicators such as employment rates, consumer spending, and job postings across counties, industries, and income groups.

All of the data displayed on the Economic Tracker can be downloaded here. In collaboration with our data partners, we are making this data freely available in order to assist in efforts to inform the public, policymakers, and researchers about the real-time state of the economy and the effects of COVID-19.

# Data Dictionary

### Overview 

Each data source and level of aggregation has a separate CSV, named using the following convention: *Data source* — *Geographic Level of Aggregation* — *Temporal Level of Aggregation*

Additionally, we have three files, **GeoIDs – State** and **GeoIDs – County** and **GeoIDs - City**, that provide information on geographic crosswalks and aggregation. These can be merged to any file sharing the same geographic level of aggregation using the geographic identifier. Additionally, **GeoIDs – County** indicates the commuting zone (CZ) and state that each county belongs to. The City-level data (listed under "Metro" on the tracker site) associates the largest cities in the United States with a representative county one-to-one (except in the case of New York City which includes the 5 boroughs).

A description of the columns in each file follows.
